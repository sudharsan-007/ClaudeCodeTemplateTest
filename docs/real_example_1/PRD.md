# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Overview
**Project Name**: Zenith - Beautiful Todo & Time Manager  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: January 2024  
**Author**: Product Team  

### Executive Summary
Zenith is a visually stunning todo application that combines task management with time awareness through an integrated clock and calendar. It features dynamic backgrounds, smooth animations, and a modern UI that makes productivity enjoyable.

### Problem Statement

- **Build Size**: < 500KB total

## UI/UX Guidelines

### Design Principles
- Glassmorphism for UI elements
- Smooth transitions (300-500ms)
- Microinteractions for all actions
- Dark mode by default with light mode option

### Key Screens (Production)
1. **Main Dashboard**: 
   - Clock prominently displayed at top
   - Todo list in center
   - Calendar toggle button
   - Add todo floating action button
2. **Calendar View**: 
   - Slide-in panel or modal
   - Month view with todo indicators
3. **Todo Form**: 
   - Modal or inline expansion
   - Minimal fields for quick entry

### Visual Style
- **Primary Color**: Dynamic based on time of day
- **Font**: Modern sans-serif (Inter, Poppins)
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace
- **Effects**: Subtle shadows, glass morphism, gradients

## Success Metrics
- **User Engagement**: Daily active usage
- **Task Completion**: % of todos marked complete
- **Performance**: No lag during animations
- **Visual Appeal**: Positive user feedback on design

## Production Release Definition
The production release must include:
1. Full todo CRUD functionality
2. Live updating clock
3. Interactive calendar
4. Dynamic time-based backgrounds
5. Smooth animations throughout
6. Data persistence
7. Category system

The initial release does NOT include:

4. Collaboration features

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Production Release (Current)
- Timeline: 2 weeks
- Focus: Core features with beautiful UI
- Success Criteria: All must-have features working smoothly

### Phase 2: Enhancement
- Timeline: 2 weeks
- Focus: Due dates, filtering, statistics
- Success Criteria: Improved productivity features

### Phase 3: Scale
- Timeline: 4 weeks
- Focus: Backend, sync, sharing
- Success Criteria: Multi-device support

## Risks and Mitigation
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Performance issues with animations | Medium | High | Use CSS animations, optimize renders |
| Browser compatibility | Low | Medium | Test across browsers early |
| Complex UI overwhelming users | Medium | Medium | Keep interactions simple |

## Open Questions
1. Should we include sound effects for actions?
2. How many custom categories should users be able to create?
3. Should completed todos be hidden or just struck through?

## Appendix
### Animation References
- Particle effects for backgrounds
- Smooth easings for transitions
- Glass morphism examples
- Time-based gradient transitions

### Technical Notes
- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Implement virtual scrolling if todo list gets long
- Consider web workers for background animations

---

**Note for Claude**: Focus on building a complete, production-ready solution. Ensure all animations are smooth and the UI is visually stunning. The app should feel premium and delightful to use. Start with the todo functionality, then add clock/calendar, and finally implement the dynamic backgrounds.
