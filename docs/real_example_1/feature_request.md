# Feature Request

## Feature Overview
**Feature Name**: Dynamic Theme & Ambient Audio System  
**Requested By**: User Experience Team  
**Date**: January 2024  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium  

## Problem Statement
Users spend long periods using the todo app throughout their day. While the visual experience is beautiful, we can enhance focus and mood by adding ambient audio and more sophisticated theming that responds to time of day and user activity patterns.

## Proposed Solution
Implement a dynamic theming system that changes colors, intensity, and background patterns based on time of day, combined with optional ambient audio that doesn't require external APIs. This creates a more immersive, productivity-focused environment.

## User Story
As a user, I want the app to automatically adjust its theme and optionally play ambient sounds based on the time of day and my activity, so that I have an optimal environment for focus and productivity throughout the day.

## Detailed Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Advanced Time-Based Theming**: 
   - Expected behavior: Theme changes every 2-3 hours with smooth transitions
   - Edge cases: Handle timezone changes, manual theme override
   - Includes: Color palette, background intensity, animation speed

2. **Ambient Audio System**:
   - Expected behavior: Optional background sounds without external APIs
   - Edge cases: User preferences, volume control, mute option
   - Uses: Web Audio API for generated sounds (rain, white noise, nature)

3. **Focus Mode**:
   - Expected behavior: Simplified UI with minimal distractions
   - Edge cases: Easy toggle, preserve current work
   - Includes: Dimmed colors, reduced animations, focus timer

### User Interface

- **Location**: Settings panel accessible from main dashboard
- **Components**: 
  - Theme intensity slider
  - Audio type selector (None, Rain, White Noise, Forest, Ocean)
  - Volume control
  - Focus mode toggle
  - Auto-theme toggle

- **User Flow**:
  1. User clicks settings/preferences icon
  2. Settings panel slides in from right
  3. User can adjust theme and audio preferences
  4. Changes apply immediately with preview
  5. Settings persist across sessions

### Data Requirements
- **Input Data**: 
  - Theme intensity preference (0-100)
  - Audio type selection
  - Volume level (0-100)
  - Focus mode preference
  - Auto-theme enabled/disabled

- **Stored Data**: All preferences in localStorage
- **Output Data**: Active theme state, audio context

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can toggle between 5 time-based theme intensities
- [ ] System automatically transitions themes every 2-3 hours
- [ ] User can select from 4 ambient audio types generated via Web Audio API
- [ ] Volume control works smoothly (0-100%)
- [ ] Focus mode reduces visual complexity by 70%
- [ ] All preferences persist across browser sessions
- [ ] Theme transitions are smooth (1-2 second fade)
- [ ] Audio loops seamlessly without gaps
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (<5% CPU)

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- Web Audio API for sound generation
- CSS custom properties for theme system
- Existing time detection system

### API Changes
- No new external APIs needed
- Add preferences management utilities
- Extend existing theme system

### Database Changes
- Add preferences object to localStorage schema:
```javascript
preferences: {
  themeIntensity: 75,
  audioType: 'rain',
  volume: 50,
  focusMode: false,
  autoTheme: true
}
```

### Security
- Web Audio API is safe and runs locally
- No external audio sources
- No sensitive data in preferences

## Impact Analysis

### Existing Features
- **Positive**: Enhances current time-based theming
- **Minimal disruption**: Settings are additive
- **Improves**: User engagement and time on app

### Performance
- **Audio**: ~1-2MB memory for audio context
- **Theming**: Minimal CSS recalculation
- **Battery**: Negligible impact with optimized audio loops

### User Experience
- **Enhanced immersion**: More engaging environment
- **Personalization**: Users control their experience
- **Accessibility**: Can disable all enhancements

## Technical Implementation

### Web Audio API Sound Generation

```javascript
// Rain sound generation
const createRainSound = (audioContext) => {
  const bufferSize = audioContext.sampleRate * 2; // 2 seconds
  const buffer = audioContext.createBuffer(1, bufferSize, audioContext.sampleRate);
  const data = buffer.getChannelData(0);
  
  for (let i = 0; i < bufferSize; i++) {
    data[i] = (Math.random() * 2 - 1) * 0.1; // White noise for rain
  }
  
  return buffer;
};
```

### Theme Intensity System

```css
:root {
  --theme-intensity: 75; /* 0-100 */
  --bg-opacity: calc(var(--theme-intensity) / 100);
  --animation-speed: calc(1s + (var(--theme-intensity) / 100) * 2s);
}
```

## Alternative Solutions Considered

1. **External Audio APIs**: Rejected due to dependency and API costs
2. **Pre-recorded Audio Files**: Rejected due to file size and loading time
3. **Simple Color Changes**: Too limited, doesn't enhance experience enough

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Theme calculation functions
- Audio context management
- Preference saving/loading

### Integration Tests
- Theme transitions during time changes
- Audio playback quality
- Settings persistence

### User Testing
- A/B test with/without ambient audio
- Theme intensity preference gathering
- Focus mode effectiveness

## Rollout Strategy
- [ ] Feature flag for gradual rollout (25% → 50% → 100%)
- [ ] Default settings: Auto-theme ON, Audio OFF
- [ ] Help tooltip on first settings access
- [ ] Optional onboarding tour

## Success Metrics
- **Usage**: % of users who enable ambient audio
- **Engagement**: Average session duration increase
- **Satisfaction**: User feedback on focus improvement
- **Performance**: No performance degradation reports

## Timeline
- **Development Start**: After core todo functionality complete
- **Code Complete**: 1 week
- **Testing Complete**: 3 days  
- **Release Date**: 2 weeks after core features

## Questions/Concerns
1. Should focus mode have a timer/pomodoro functionality?
2. What's the ideal volume level default?
3. Should we add haptic feedback on mobile?

## Additional Notes

### Audio Types Description
- **Rain**: Soft white noise with irregular patterns
- **White Noise**: Consistent, gentle static
- **Forest**: Low-frequency rumbles with subtle variations
- **Ocean**: Rhythmic wave-like patterns

### Focus Mode Changes
- Reduce background animation intensity by 70%
- Dim non-essential UI elements
- Larger, more readable fonts
- Simplified color palette
- Hide non-critical information

**Note for Claude**: Implement this feature with production quality - properly tested, documented, and ready for deployment. Ensure smooth audio loops and efficient theme transitions. The Web Audio API should generate all sounds procedurally to avoid external dependencies.
